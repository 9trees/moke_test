We can look at the above results in a simple way to find the dependence of reaction rate (i.e., rate of disappearance of \\[B{{r}_{2}}\\]). From data (1) and (2) in which concentration of \\[C{{H}_{3}}COC{{H}_{3}}\\] and \\[{{H}^{+}}\\] remain unchanged and only the concentration of \\[B{{r}_{2}}\\] is doubled, there is no change in rate of reaction. It means the rate of reaction is independent of concentration of \\[B{{r}_{2}}.\\] Again from (2) and (3) in which \\[(C{{H}_{3}}COC{{H}_{3}})\\] and \\[(B{{r}_{2}})\\] remain constant but \\[{{H}^{+}}\\] increases from 0.05 M to 0.10 i.e. doubled, the rate of reaction changes from \\[5.7\\times {{10}^{-5}}\\] to \\[1.2\\times {{10}^{-4}}\\]\\[(or\\,12\\times {{10}^{-5}}),\\]thus it also becomes almost doubled. It shows that rate of reaction is directly proportional to \\[[{{H}^{+}}].\\] From (3) and (4), the rate should have doubled due to increase in conc of \\[[{{H}^{+}}]\\] from 0.10 M to 0.20 M but the rate has changed from \\[1.2\\times {{10}^{-4}}\\]to \\[3.1\\times {{10}^{-4}}.\\] This is due to change in concentration of \\[C{{H}_{3}}COC{{H}_{3}}\\] from 0.30 M to 0.40 M. Thus the rate is directly proportional to \\[[C{{H}_{3}}COC{{H}_{3}}].\\] We now get rate \\[=k{{[C{{H}_{3}}COC{{H}_{3}}]}^{1}}{{[B{{r}_{2}}]}^{0}}{{[{{H}^{+}}]}^{1}}\\] \\[=k[C{{H}_{3}}COC{{H}_{3}}][{{H}^{+}}].\\] ",
